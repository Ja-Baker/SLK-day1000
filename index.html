This pathway is ideal for those who need to reorganize their speech sound system.

This pathway supports those with motor-based speech disorders, such as apraxia.

Instead of learning single words and combining them into phrases, they acquire and use whole sentences, scripts, or song lyrics that they have heard elsewhere.

                <h2>Motor Speech Curriculum</h2>
                <p>Motor speech disorders, such as childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) and dysarthria, affect a child's ability to plan, coordinate, and produce speech sounds accurately. Unlike articulation or phonological disorders, which stem from difficulties with specific sounds or patterns, motor speech disorders are rooted in challenges with motor planning, sequencing, and execution of movements needed for clear speech. These difficulties can result in inconsistent speech errors, trouble producing longer words, difficulty transitioning between sounds, and even physical struggle during speech production.</p>

Children who mumble may drop sounds, speak too quickly, or fail to fully articulate words, often without realizing it. While their speech may technically be correct, the lack of clarity, volume, or articulation can interfere with communication, leading to frustration in academic and social settings.</p>

                    <p>At the Beginner Level, therapy focuses on helping the child become aware of their speech clarity by practicing intentional overarticulation in structured activities. Many children who mumble are unaware that their speech is unclear, so this stage emphasizes exaggerating speech movements, slowing down, and fully pronouncing words to establish a foundation for clear communication. By using overarticulation in structured tasks, the child learns what clear speech feels and sounds like, making it easier to carry over into everyday interactions.</p>

                    <p>At the Advanced Level, the focus is on independent self-monitoring—helping the child recognize when their speech is unclear and correct it without external cues. By this stage, they have practiced overarticulation and responding to prompts, and now the goal is for them to naturally adjust their clarity in everyday conversations. Therapy at this level emphasizes real-time awareness, self-correction, and maintaining clear speech across different settings, ensuring that improved articulation and volume become a consistent habit in daily interactions.</p>

                <h2>Following Directions Curriculum</h2>
                <p>The ability to understand and follow directions is a foundational language skill that impacts a child's ability to function in the classroom, follow routines, and engage in social interactions. Some children struggle with following directions due to difficulty processing language, remembering steps, or understanding key concepts like spatial terms, sequencing, or conditionals. These challenges can lead to frustration, difficulty completing tasks, and reduced independence in academic and everyday situations.</p>

                    <p>At the Intermediate Level, therapy focuses on helping children retell past events in a clear, logical order. Many children who struggle with this skill may jump around in their story, leave out important details, or assume the listener already knows what happened. During this stage, children learn to provide context, include key details, and organize their thoughts using sequencing words (e.g., first, then, last).</p>

                <p>Developing abstract language skills is essential for understanding nuanced communication, engaging in complex conversations, and interpreting meaning beyond literal words. Some children struggle with abstract language because they rely heavily on concrete thinking, which can make it difficult to grasp figurative expressions, infer unstated meanings, or detect humor and sarcasm. These difficulties can impact social interactions, academic performance, and comprehension of both spoken and written language.</p>

						<p><b>5 - Mastery:</b> Has a word or phrase for everything they need and consistently uses words to communicate wants, needs, and observations in various contexts. Uses at least 100+ words and begins combining words into simple phrases.</p>
						<p><b>4 - Proficient:</b> Uses a broad vocabulary to describe and categorize items, including some precise words for actions and emotions (e.g., “exhausted” instead of “tired”).</p>
						<p><b>3 - Developing:</b> Has an expanding vocabulary including around 75-150 words, covering common categories like animals, food, transportation, and emotions. Can describe familiar objects with some detail and uses more than one word to express ideas (e.g., “big red truck” instead of just “truck”). Uses simple sentences but relies on basic, familiar words.</p>
						<p><b>2 - Emerging:</b> Uses 50-75 words, mainly for familiar nouns, verbs, and simple adjectives. Struggles to find precise words and often repeats the same basic vocabulary. Needs prompting to describe objects or explain ideas.</p>
						<p><b>1 - Beginning:</b> Uses fewer than 50 words, mostly relying on common nouns and a few verbs (e.g., "go," "eat"). Struggles to name new objects or actions without direct prompting. Often resorts to gestures or general words like “that” instead of specific vocabulary.</p>

						<p><b>5 - Mastery:</b> Independently applies multiple strategies (morphology, context clues, synonyms/antonyms, multiple meanings) to determine word meaning and provides a well-explained definition using academic language. Can confidently use the word in a sentence and explain how they figured it out.</p>
						<p><b>4 - Proficient:</b> Uses two or more strategies to determine word meaning with minimal support. Can explain their reasoning and use the word in a meaningful sentence, though explanations may lack full academic depth.</p>
						<p><b>3 - Developing:</b> Uses at least one strategy (e.g., breaking the word into parts, using context clues) but needs prompting to apply additional strategies. Provides a general idea of the word’s meaning but may struggle with accurate word use.</p>
						<p><b>2 - Emerging:</b> Recognizes the word as unfamiliar and attempts a strategy (e.g., guessing based on prior knowledge) but needs moderate prompting to apply effective word-learning techniques. Struggles to explain their reasoning.</p>
						<p><b>1 - Beginning:</b> Has difficulty identifying or analyzing new words independently. Needs maximum support to apply strategies and determine meaning. Often guesses without using a structured approach.</p>

                <p>The ability to ask and answer questions is a core language skill that supports learning, social interactions, and problem-solving. Some children struggle with this skill due to difficulty understanding question types, recalling information, or formulating appropriate responses. Others may have trouble knowing when and how to ask questions to seek information or clarify confusion. These challenges can impact participation in conversations, classroom discussions, and daily functional tasks.</p>

                <p>Strong language skills are the foundation for successful literacy development. Many children who struggle with reading and writing have underlying language weaknesses that impact their ability to comprehend text, express ideas clearly, and engage in meaningful conversations. This curriculum plays an essential role in supporting the language components of literacy, ensuring children develop the skills they need to understand and use language effectively in reading and writing.</p>

                    	<p><b>5 – Strongly Ready:</b> The individual shows strong phonological awareness (e.g., blends and segments sounds, identifies rhymes), understands that print carries meaning, tracks print left to right, recognizes many letters, and engages appropriately with books. They can retell a familiar story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.</p>
						<p><b>4 – Ready:</b> The individual identifies rhyming words and some beginning sounds, can blend or segment simple words with minimal support, understands that print represents spoken language, handles books appropriately, and recognizes some letters. They can generally retell a familiar story with at least two parts (e.g., beginning and end), though the sequence may be incomplete or inconsistent.</p>
						<p><b>3 – Emerging Readiness</b> The individual shows some awareness of sounds in words (e.g., noticing rhyme or initial sounds) but struggles with manipulating sounds (e.g. blending and segmentation). They show interest in books and may recognize that print has meaning but inconsistently track or engage with text. They may describe one or two parts of a story but lack clear understanding of full story structure.</p>
						<p><b>2 – Limited Readiness</b> The individual occasionally notices sounds or rhymes but is unable to manipulate them. They may flip through books or look at pictures but lack understanding of print direction or purpose. Story recall is minimal or disorganized, with no clear beginning, middle, or end structure.</p>
						<p><b>1 – Not Yet Ready</b> The individual does not demonstrate awareness of sound patterns, shows little interest in books or how print works, and is not yet identifying or retelling any parts of a story. Foundational literacy concepts have not yet developed.</p>

                    <p>At this stage, individuals move beyond basic literacy readiness and learn how different types of texts are structured. Understanding narratives, informational texts, and opinion-based writing is essential for both comprehension and writing skills. Therapy at this level focuses on helping individuals recognize, interpret, and organize information within various text structures.</p>

                        <p>By the end of the reporting period, ________ will demonstrate understanding and use of a variety of discourse structures in both spoken and written language by achieving at least a 4 out of 5 on the following rubric as graded by the classroom teacher over the preceding two weeks:</p>
						<p><b>5 – Mastery:</b> Demonstrates consistent, independent use of a variety of discourse structures across both spoken and written language. Narratives are coherent and well-structured with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Informational language includes clearly stated main ideas supported by relevant details. Opinions are expressed with clear reasoning and supporting evidence. These forms are used flexibly and purposefully in both conversation and writing.</p>
						<p><b>4 – Proficient:</b> Effectively uses narrative, informational, and opinion discourse in spoken language, with emerging consistency in written communication. Storytelling follows a logical sequence with some detail. Main ideas and supporting details are typically present when sharing information. Opinions are expressed clearly with basic justification. Written forms show developing organization but may lack clarity or full elaboration.</p>
						<p><b>3 – Developing:</b> Demonstrates emerging use of multiple discourse structures in spoken language, though performance may be inconsistent or incomplete. Narratives may have basic structure but limited detail or clarity. Informational content may include isolated facts without a clear main idea or organized structure. Opinions may be stated without support. Attempts at written discourse are present but minimal or disorganized.</p>
						<p><b>2 – Beginning:</b> Uses some discourse forms in spoken communication, but structure and clarity are limited. Narratives may be difficult to follow or missing key parts. Informational content may be vague or disconnected. Opinions may be expressed but without explanation. Written attempts are rare or lack recognizable structure.</p>
						<p><b>1 – Emerging:</b> Shows minimal use or understanding of distinct discourse structures in either spoken or written form. Communication lacks organization and purpose. Narratives, information sharing, and opinions may be present as isolated ideas without clear structure or intent. Written expression is not yet developed in these areas.</p>

						<p><b>5 – Mastery:</b> Consistently applies critical thinking skills to both reading and writing tasks. Demonstrates deep understanding of texts by making inferences, interpreting abstract language, and identifying author’s purpose or perspective. Written responses are well-organized, clearly reasoned, and supported with relevant evidence or examples.</p>
						<p><b>4 – Proficient:</b> Effectively applies critical thinking to interpret and respond to texts.

						<p><b>3 – Developing:</b> Shows emerging use of critical thinking when engaging with texts. Understands the general message but struggles to interpret deeper meaning or connect ideas. Written responses include basic ideas that are somewhat related to the text but may lack organization, reasoning, or support.</p>
						<p><b>2 – Beginning:</b> Applies limited critical thinking to reading and writing. Responses tend to be literal, with minimal interpretation or reflection. Written work may be unclear, unorganized, or lacking in logical development and supporting ideas.</p>
						<p><b>1 – Emerging:</b> Critical thinking skills are not yet evident in reading or writing tasks. Struggles to identify key ideas, make meaning from text, or express related thoughts in writing. Responses are minimal, off-topic, or absent.	</p>

                <h2>Cycles Approach for Language Curriculum (Core Language Program)</h2>
                <p>A <strong>cyclical approach</strong> (also called a rotating or cycles approach) is a goal attack strategy where several therapy targets are addressed in succession for fixed intervals, rather than working on one goal until mastery or targeting all goals at once. <a href="https://clinicaltreatment.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/tyler2003.pdf#:~:text=multiple%20goals%20are%20approached%20or,Weiss%20%282002%29%20suggested%20that" target="_blank">Fey (1986)</a> defined a cyclical strategy as one in which multiple goals are each targeted for a specified period of time independent of performance accuracy, and then the sequence of goals is repeated.</p>
                <p>The rationale behind a cycles approach is that <strong>individuals often benefit from distributed practice on various skills over time</strong>; even if an individual hasn't mastered a skill before switching to the next, the skill will be revisited in later cycles. This mirrors typical development – children gradually refine multiple language or speech skills in parallel, rather than perfecting one sound or structure before learning another.</p>
                <p><strong>If an individual is struggling in many areas of language, it may be beneficial to try a cyclical approach</strong> to therapy so that you can help them make progress in many areas of language simultaneously. Keep in mind though, if the individual is NOT making progress with this type of an approach, you can always switch back to a more narrow focus on one skill area or <a href="index.html#language" target="_blank">Curriculum</a> at a time to ensure progress before moving on.</p>

					<p><b>****NOTE on Neurodiversity:</b></p>
					<p>Perspective-taking and empathy training have gotten a bad wrap with our newer understanding of neurodiversity.  But that's simply because the way we used to teach these skills was....maybe not the best.  Our old teaching ways were (inadvertently) telling children that they needed to act like everyone else.  That there was something wrong with them because their brains worked differently.</p>
					<p>We now know that all brains work differently and there are many different "normal" ways of being!  And this is amazingly empowering!  But our neurodiverse populations still deserve to understand what's going on around them.</p>
					<p>So now, we teach perspective-taking as a way to understand the world around us.  Not because we want kids to change and conform.  But because they will feel more safe, secure, and loved if they understand why others do the things they do.  And they can navigate social situations their own way.</p>

                <h2>Cluttering Curriculum</h2>
                <p>Cluttering is a fluency disorder where a person’s speech sounds fast, uneven, or jumbled, making it hard to follow. Individuals who clutter may speak in bursts, leave out sounds or parts of words, or have disorganized language. Unlike stuttering, cluttering is less about getting “stuck” on words and more about talking too quickly or in a way that feels rushed and unclear.</p>
                <p>One simple way to distinguish cluttering from stuttering, is that individuals who clutter will sound more clear when they are asked to slow down.  Slowing down doesn’t usually help those who stutter as much.</p>
				<p>Choose the level below that best fits this individual’s current level.  You don’t necessarily need to start at the first level if they have advanced beyond it.</p>

							<ol>
								<li>Adding pauses to slow down the perceived rate of speech</li>
								<li>Over-articulating (or over-exaggerating the pronunciation of speech sounds) in single words, phrases, and sentences, including with multi-syllabic words</li>
								<li>Over-emphasizing the endings of words in single words, phrases, and sentences</li>
